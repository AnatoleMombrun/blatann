# Blatann

bl√•tann: Norwegian word for "blue tooth"

The goal of this library is to provide a high-level, object-oriented interface
for performing bluetooth operations using the Nordic nRF52 through Nordic's `pc-ble-driver-py` library
and the associated Connectivity firmware.

### Install

`pip install blatann`

#### Supported Devices/Software

This has been tested using both the nRF52832 Dev Kit and the [ABSniffer 528](https://blog.aprbrother.com/product/absniffer-usb-dongle-528) flashed with Connectivity Firmware

This API implements against Connectivity Firmware for SoftDevice v3. This does NOT support the nRF51 or SoftDevice v2.

Currently only Python 2.7 is supported. This is a limitation of the `pc-ble-driver-py` library only building the SWIG modules for v2.
If the aforementioned library ever supports Python 3+, this library will be updated also. Or, if I find spare time and this library
is stable I'll work on building the modules myself and remove pc-ble-driver-py as a dependency altogether.

The library aims to support both event-driven and procedural program styles. It takes similar paradigms from C#/.NET's event function signatures,
where event handlers are passed  `object sender, EventArgs e`. In addition, asynchronous function calls return a `Waitable` object which
can be waited on (with timeout) until the event associated with the function call returns.

**NOTE**

This library is very much a work in progress. Interfaces, objects, method names **will** change.
